### How to get Help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bug reports and feature requests. Please **search existing Issues first**,
before making a new request.

If you have any problems or suggestions for improvement that have not yet been described, simply open a new [issue][issue-url].

For help and questions about using my projects, please use the [Stack Overflow Questions][soq-url] first.

### Technical Support

This is free software and for that reason the [license agreement][license-url] already states:

**This program is released in the hope that you will find it useful, but without any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.**

If something gets stuck, I'll still help (as far as I can).
